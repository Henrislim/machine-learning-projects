# Introduction
In this repository, I present some interesting Machine Learning projects to predict to explore interesting information from real data.
Each file is an independant project, and datasets have been included in these projects.

# Lending Club:[a relative link](lending_club.ipynb)
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. 
In this project, we use supervised learning models to identify whether the LC loan will be default in the future.

# Watch Reviews:[a relative link](wathch_reviews.ipynb)
Watches are popular gifts on Amazon.
We use unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled watch reviews into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.

# Bank Customer:[a relative link](bank_customer.ipynb)
Banks may want to know/predict whether their clients would close their accounts in the future so that the banks can take measures to keep the clients.
we use supervised learning models to identify customers who are likely to churn. 
Furthermore, we will analyze top factors that influence user retention.
